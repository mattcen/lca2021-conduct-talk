## Acknowledgement of Country

Note:
In the spirit of reconciliation I'd like to acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of country throughout Australia and their connections to land, sea and community.

I pay my respect to their elders past and present and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples today.

## My experience

* Written and contributed to codes of conduct for several organisations
* Spent 2 years on the CoC committee of Linux.conf.au
* Studied literature on diversity, inclusion, and communication
* **Not a lawyer**

Note:
So my background is in Linux sysadmin, but I've also spent quite a lot of time as a community organiser. In that capacity, I've written and contributed to codes of conduct for several organisations, spent 2 years on the LCA safety team, and spent lots of time researching diversity, inclusion, and communication.

Please don't take any of this presentation as legal advice though, because I'm not a lawyer.

## Overview

* Purpose and content of codes of conduct
* Applying a code of conduct
* Incident response
* Code of conduct review

Notes:
A quick overview of what I'll be covering today, is that we'll go through the purpose and content of a good code of conduct, how to apply a code of conduct and respond to incidents, and then review what a good code of conduct looks like.

---

## Purpose of codes of conduct

* To protect a community's members from harm within that community's spaces
* It both protects and applies to *everyone* within the community
* If it doesn't apply equally to everyone, it won't do its job - creates power imbalance
* Especially important for new people, and marginalised or underrepresented community members

Notes:

The Professional Accounts in Business Committee defines a code of conduct as:
> Principles, values, standards, or rules of behavior that guide the decisions, procedures and systems of an organization in a way that (a) contributes to the welfare of its key stakeholders, and (b) respects the rights of all constituents affected by its operations.

Codes of conduct are especially important for new people to the community, as well marginalised or underrepresented community members, such as people of underrepresented genders, sexualities, abilities, races, and religions.

---

## Code of conduct contents

* Intent: what is the Code for?
* Scope: where does this Code apply?
* Unacceptable behaviour
* Consequences for violation
* How and where to report incidents (detailed process - maybe a template)
* Who will handle reports (individual names)
* Promise to take reports seriously, and recuse handlers with conflicts of interest
* Emergency services contact details
* Links to related document (optional)

---

## How a code of conduct works

* Education
* Norm-following
* Attraction and repulsion
* Deterrence:
* Boundary setting

Note:
* Education: describes an expected standard of behaviour
* Norm-following: peer pressure based on others' behaviour
* Attraction and repulsion: people will self-select into or out of your community
* Deterrence: creating consequences for unacceptable behaviour
* Boundary setting: keeping unsafe people outside the community (if they behave unacceptably)

---

## The Paradox of Tolerance

> A tolerant society must be tolerant of everything — except intolerance itself

Note:

If a community tolerates intolerance, it will eventually be taken over by the intolerant.

Applying a code of conduct helps protect a tolerant community from destruction.

---

## What a code of conduct can't do

* Punish
* Transformative or restorative justice
* Protect community from external harm
* Mediation
* Force apology or forgiveness

Note:
Codes of conduct aren't law; our communities aren't equivalent to wider society.

* Punish: can only exclude harmful people from community; defer illegal activity to law enforcement
* Transformative or restorative justice: best suited for *society*, where exclusion harms both individual and society
* Protect community from external harm: requires too much effort and training. Only work within your community
* Mediation: Changes "what do we do about this harmful person?" to "let's try to help these two people get along; if not, oh well"
* Force apology or forgiveness: These only work if they're voluntary, sincere, demonstration of understanding of wrongdoing, and commitment to improve

---

## Code of conduct summary

* Codes of conduct both protect and apply to all members of the community
* List goal, unacceptable behaviours, consequences, reporting instructions/process, related documents
* Work via education, norm-following, attraction/repulsion, deterrence, boundary setting
* Intolerance must not be tolerated
* Can't punish, enact justice, operate outside community, force apologies/forgiveness

---

## Applying a code of conduct

Note:

Let's move on to actually putting a code of conduct into practice.

---

### Publish code of conduct

* Should be one of the first things new community members see
* Easy to find:
  * Top level website menu
  * Linked from footers of mailing list emails
  * On posters around venues
* Referenced as required reading on community sign-up forms

Visible code of conduct reduces the "I didn't know this behaviour was unacceptable" excuse.

---

### Code of conduct committee (safety team)

* Puts code of conduct into practice (responds to incident reports)
* Is supported by community leadership, not overruled
* Carefully hand-picked (otherwise falls back marginalised members)
* Identified by name in reporting instructions ("Who will handle my report?")
* Handful of people, replaced with overlap
* Is a diverse group of people:
  * Marginalised folks (familiar with oppression)
  * Outspoken folks (likely to take reports seriously and follow through)
  * Respected community members (Increases chances community will accept decisions)

---

## Communication with committee and community

* Efficient channel within committee, e.g. IM chat
* Trade contact details within committee
* Who communicates with community?
* Who reviews these updates?
* How are updates signed?

---

## Responding to criticism

* Some members have nothing better to do than argue
* Entering dialogue about decisions dilutes resolution, causes stress, exasperation, mistakes (e.g. sharing too much detail)
* Bike-shedding

---

## Charles' Rules of Argument
http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Charles'_Rules_of_Argument

* Avoid engaging with strong disagreements
* Await reactions to initial announcement
* If necessary, post *one* follow-up to clarify
* Don't provide additional incident/response details
* Don't enter one-on-one arguments
* Redirect community-wide discussions to smaller venues

---

## Application summary

* Prominently publish: code of conduct, incident reporting procedure, list of committee members
* Committee supported by leadership, handful of diverse members (oppressed, outspoken, respected)
* Publish outcomes
* Follow up only *once* to clarify

---

## Incident response

Note:

Let's go into more detail about crafting incident response guides, which outline the process to follow for responding to code of conduct incidents as they arise.

----

### Incident response guide

* Investigating existing guides (e.g. https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports)
* Don't treat it like legal code (it's more flexible than that)
* Commit to deadlines on responses and resolutions
* Don't publish internal guide (bike-shedding, lawyering)
* Maybe publish overview of response process, mentioning internal guide exists
* How to address non-unanimous decisions
* Record responses
* Update process & policy where necessary, even during ongoing incident responses

----

### Responding to a report (1/2)

1. Start response deadline clock
2. Check that everyone is safe
3. Ensure report is written down
4. Make preliminary announcement if appropriate ("aware of incident; working on it")
5. Ask for recusals

----

### Responding to a report (2/2)

6. Organise committee meeting
7. Do additional research
8. Meet as committee
9. Choose a response
10. Take action
11. Inform target and harasser of response
12. Communicate response to others
13. Respond to criticism (sparingly)

Note:
* Check lists of "avoid" and "approved" responses. E.g. Avoid: mediation, requesting apology. Thinking clearly is hard under stress, so lists are good
* Community response: concise, unambiguous. Show we take issues seriously, but don't identify parties

---


### Incident summary

* Response guide is just a guide - not legal code
* Commit to deadlines
* Don't publish internal process - publish overview if necessary
* Keep records of incident response
* Update documentation where necessary
* Maintain safety of targets and wider community
* Communicate outcomes
* Respond cautiously to criticism

Tables I and II, Tourani, Adams, and Serebrenik 2017

Notes:

This table, from a 2017 paper on codes of conduct used in open source projects, list some popular codes of conduct: In descending order of popularity according to hits on GitHub, they are: the Contributor Covenant, the Open Code of Conduct, and the Python, Citizen, Ubuntu, Django, and Geek Feminism codes of conduct.

---

## Contributor Covenant

* Code of conduct for contributors to free/open source software projects, created in 2014
* Claims adoption by over 40,000 communities
* Example of a good code of conduct

Notes:

Given it's the most popular, let's take a closer look at the Contributor Covenant. It was created in 2014, and is used by over 40,000 communities.

----

## Contributor Covenant unacceptable behaviour

> * The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
> * Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
> * Public or private harassment
> * Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
> * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Note:

The Covenant has a clear list of unacceptable behaviour, including trolling, personal and political attacks, harassment, publishing private information without permission, or "other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting."

----

## Contributor Covenant scope

> This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Note:

The Covenant also defines where it applies, including official community spaces, or for interactions between members when one is officially representing the community in public.

----

## Contributor Covenant process

> Instances of ... unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]...
>
> Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:
>
> 1. Correction
> 2. Warning
> 3. Temporary Ban
> 4. Permanent Ban

Note:

The Covenant's process is outlined, stating how to report incidents, and potential consequences of violation, including correction, warning, or temporary or permanent bans from the community.

----

## Contributor Covenant summary

Hits most recommendations for a Code of Conduct, but:

* Doesn't have space to list individuals handling reports
* Doesn't explicitly promise to avoid conflicts of interest
* Includes a "pledge" to behave constructively

---

## Conclusion

* What a codes of conduct is, and what it should contain
* How to apply a code of conduct
